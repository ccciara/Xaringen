# Introduction to MTG
- The latest series of geostationary meteorological satellites

- Developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) with the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT)

- Designed to enhance weather forecasting and monitoring abilities for the next 20 years

## Sensors onboard MTG Satellites

####Lightning Imager (LI)
- Detects and locates lightning activity across Europe and Africa.
- Aids in early warning of severe weather conditions.

####Flexible Combined Imager (FCI)
- Captures high-resolution images of Earth in 16 spectral channels.
- Improved spatial and temporal resolution for more detailed weather observations.

####Infrared Sounder (IRS)
- Provides high-precision temperature and humidity profiles of the atmosphere.
- Enhances weather prediction models and severe weather forecasting.

####Search & Rescue Transponder
- Supports international search and rescue operations.
- Detects and relays distress signals from emergency beacons.

#MTG's Lightning Imager

- First LI capable of detecting single bolts of lightning rather than clusters

- Capable of filtering out light to not incorrectly flag sun reflections

- Electronic cards calibrate image brightness to aid in detection process, in order to detect lightning in areas that are extremely dark as well as areas that are very bright.

- AI based processors reduce 99.9% of unnecessary satellite-to-Earth data transmission by rejecting all data not related to lightning

## Studies incorporating MTG Data

The study "Assimilation of Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) Lightning Imager (LI) pseudo-observations in AROME-France – proof of concept" in Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences used data from MTG to study convective weather systems like thunderstorms, in order to improve analysis and accurate forecasts. 

Cloud electrification and lightning are created by interactions within convective clouds, making lightning bolts a useful indication of a storm's convective intensity. 

By incorporating more lightning data into meteorological research, people can have more warning and preparation time before the arrival of dangerous storms, potentially saving many lives and livelihoods.

## Importance of Lightning Detection

This technology has more uses than predicting major storms far in advance. Storm monitory capabilities and short term predictions known as "nowcasting" will help industries such as agriculture, transportation and tourism work around storms that could otherwise cause delays and negative impacts. The benefits of using this satellite data for these purposes are estimated to be worth 61 billion euros per year.


An increasing consequence of climate change is unpredictable weather patterns; as the frequency of these events continues to rise, the importance of forecasting and nowcasting will also increase.
